Reader View
===========

This is a porting of Firefox Reader View to Opera and Chrome.

Reader View is a feature that strips away clutter like buttons, ads and 
background images, and changes the page's text size, contrast and layout for 
better readability.

Reader View settings are easily customizable to fit your 
reading preferences.
