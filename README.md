Reader View
===========

This is a porting of Firefox Reader View to Opera and Chrome.

Reader View strips away clutter like buttons, ads and background images, 
and changes the page's text size, contrast and layout to improve readability.

Reader View settings are easily customizable to fit your reading preferences.
